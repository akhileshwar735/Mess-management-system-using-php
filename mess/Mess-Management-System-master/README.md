# Mess Management System

This project is done as a part of our DBMS Course in S5 BTech in National Institute of Technology, Calicut. The project aims to create a unified mess management system which can be used in a mess system like the one present in NITC. There are two types of users who can use this database system:
  - Mess Administrator
  - Mess User

### Mess Administrator
A mess admin can use this management system to keep track of monthly users of the respective messes and their extras expenditure. A unified EXTRAS database stores the
price of all common extras used in messes. The admin can use the interface provided to update the expenditures of the users daily.

### Mess User
A mess user can use the management system to know his mess details and monthly expenses.
